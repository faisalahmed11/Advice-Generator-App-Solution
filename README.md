## My process

Using HTML, CSS and JS Learnings, I started implementing UI design from the outer most container, matching the width and height of the different components. then putting all the sub-components, and after this, comes the most interesting part you might have guessed, it is called CSS Styling.
off course, it backs life in it, colors, images and design was given already so it became easy to full fill it.

The tricky part of this challenge is about making a responsive background from two svg background images. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
